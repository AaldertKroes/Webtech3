# Webtech3
A simple memory game that is made with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

No framework is used for this project as of yet,
everything you can see here right now is written from scratch.

## Info
All the work done is with the requirements in mind of this link:
`https://hanze-hbo-ict.github.io/webtech3/index.html`

Before this server is running, the backend needs to be set up.
Make sure the backend is running on `localhost:8000`

To start the server:
```
cd .../Webtech3/src
php -S localhost:9000
```
Then navigate to `localhost:9000/html/index.html`.
It is *vital* to run this app on `port 9000`. All the requests and redirects are sent to this port.
